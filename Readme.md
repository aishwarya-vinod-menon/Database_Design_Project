Neo4j vs Relational Database

Description

This project is a university research graph database designed to manage complex networks of academic research data.

Installation 
We have majorly used these three softwares in the course of our project. 
	•	Neo4j Installation:
           Download and install Neo4j from the official website. Follow the installation guide for your operating system. After installation, start the Neo4j server and open the Neo4j Browser to interact with the database.
	•	MySQL Installation:  Install MySQL by downloading the appropriate installer from the MySQL Downloads page. Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions to set up the server and create your root user.

	•	Python 3.10.5 Installation:  Python 3.10.5 can be installed from the Python Downloads  
After installation, follow these steps to ensure proper working. 
For macOS:

	•	Download the Installer: Go to the Python Downloads page and download the latest Python installer for macOS.

	•	Run the Installer: Open the downloaded file (a package file with a .pkg extension).This will open the Python Installer; follow the prompts to install Python. You might need to enter your administrator password.

	•	Verify the Installation: Open the Terminal app (you can find it in the Applications > Utilities folder or search for it using Spotlight). Type python3 --version and press Enter. You should see the Python version you installed displayed.

	•	Add Python to PATH (if necessary): In most cases, the installer should automatically add Python to your PATH. If you find that the python3 command is not recognized, you may need to add Python to your PATH manually. This is less common with recent Python installers for macOS.

	•	Install pip (if not included):

	•	Modern Python versions come with pip installed. You can check by typing pip3 --version in the Terminal. If it's not installed, you can download get-pip.py from https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py and run it with Python.

For Windows:

	•	Download the Installer: Visit the Python Downloads page for Windows and download the installer suitable for your version of Windows (32-bit or 64-bit).

	•	Run the Installer: Run the downloaded executable file. Important: Make sure to check the box that says “Add Python 3.x to PATH” before clicking “Install Now.” Follow the rest of the prompts to complete the installation.

	•	Verify the Installation: Open Command Prompt (you can search for cmd in the Start menu). Type python --version and press Enter. You should see the Python version you installed. Similarly, you can check pip by typing pip --version.

	•	Install pip (if not included): If for some reason pip was not installed, you can download get-pip.py as mentioned above and run it using Python.
